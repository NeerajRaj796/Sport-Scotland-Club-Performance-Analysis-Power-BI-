🏅 Sport Scotland, Membership & Coaching Analysis (Power BI)

📌 Project Overview

This project was undertaken as a self-initiated Power BI challenge to deepen my skills in data modelling, DAX calculations, and analytical storytelling using real-world public sector data.

Using publicly available data from the sportscotland website, I analysed how sport participation is changing over time across Scotland, focusing on club members, participants, and coaching capacity. The report highlights year-on-year (YoY) trends, demographic composition, and geographic variation to support evidence-based decision-making.

🎯 Context & Data Source

sportscotland works with Scottish Governing Bodies (SGBs) to increase participation in sport across Scotland.
As part of this, data is published annually covering:

Club membership

Participants (non-members)

Coaches

Local authority distribution

This project analyses three years of data (2023–2025) for one governing body.

📊 Dashboard Structure

The Power BI report is organised into three analytical pages, supported by a custom navigation menu built using bookmarks and buttons for a professional, app-like experience.

📈 Page 1: Club Members – Year-on-Year Performance

![Club Members – Year-on-Year Performance](Club-Members-Page.png)
